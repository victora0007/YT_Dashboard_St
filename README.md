## Overview 
This is the notebook to follow along with my data science portfolio from scratch project. I go through and build a dashboard using my YouTube data that you can expand upon to share in your portfolio. This is a unique project because I am the stakeholder and I can tell you exactly what I would be looking for in a product. 

I hope this helps you on your data science journey!
